Here is where we will start to build our serverless website that will host out very awesome TnC transcoder.

So our first stepis to goand register an account and setup some settings on auth0's site.

   A. Go to https://auth0.com, Follow on screen instructions.
   B. Make sure to choose "US" as the region.
   C. Click next, fill out the needed information nad click on Create account.
   D. Click on Clients inthe left panel and choose "Default App".
   E. Then go to connections and make sure that Only username-password Authentication is enabled ( for me the default was on for google so disable that).
   F. Go to settings in the default app menu, and inside of the textbox for ALLOWED Origins (CORS) enter http://localhost:8100 for the value.
   G. Scroll down and click show advanced settings choose the Oauth menu and change "JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm" from RS256 to HS256.

   I. Scroll down and save settings, then scroll up to top and save the values for Domain,Client Id, and Client secret.
   J.open up the config.js file and enter them values in the locations that ask for them.
   K.go to the folder where you saved the files for this lesson (make sure its the one with the package.json file) and do a npm install to install all the modules you will need
   L. Do a npm start, which will launch a local server and you can see whats up so far, go to http://localhost:8100
   M. Not much to it now, but we will get there
